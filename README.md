How to
------------
I really need to write instruction, but for now you can only share this project and follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vilkastakan) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/n5xe7xa9ygnl8o1mta2cg7yy9?si=RpSiNyYmRcihYmhXckTaFg)

Based on [Mikhail's Telegram Bot](https://github.com/mikhailsdv/spotify-playing-now) (there is instruction in russian, just use ENVs, not config)
